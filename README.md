The following repository contains contains this structure:

**1.** **Solution_excercises**: in this folder there is a notebook with the statement of each point and its development.

**2.** **Unsupervised**: in this folder you will find the ***"unsupervised"*** package that is derived from point 4, and that contains the following structure:

unsupervised/

     /__init__.py

     dimensionality_reduction/

         /__init__.py

         /kmeans_.py

         /kmedoids.py

         /pca.py

         /svd.py

         /tsne.py

**Additional topics:**

- Added a text file called "packages.txt" to execute some actions in the terminal as the workshop unfolded.

- Added a text file called "requirements.txt" to run the python packages used in the development of points in bulk.

- Finally the ".gitignore" file to remove junk code information, which distorts the presentation of the work content.
